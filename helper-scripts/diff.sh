# Single file compare for test output comparison
# Should be added as alias or placed to the root for easy use
# Done by phakakos, Hive Helsinki 2020

# Example usage would be ft_printf and printf output comparison
# Output should be formatted:
# user output\n
# test output\n
# user output\n
# test output\n
# ...
# Order can be switched around, the comparison will be handled the same
# Handles empty lines

# Replacement value for "" lines.
# Uses current ISO time to make it have randomness to make it almost impossible for
# the test cases to match the replacement
EMPTY_LINE="empty"$(date +%s)

# To compare empty output lines
test_line()
